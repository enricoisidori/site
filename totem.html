        totem /ˈtoʊtəm/ n. [from an Algonquian indigenous term, ototeman
        (denoting kinship relations among siblings)]. – (ethnol.) [an animal,
        plant, object, or phenomenon that, in animistic cultures, is the object
        of taboo and worship].<br /><br />
        August 2021 — August 2023<br />
        This pig is ugly, it’s dirty, picked up off the street by my brother.
        Once home, it’s placed on my nightstand. My brother and I split the same
        room, a shared space with personal areas: bed, nightstand, bookshelf,
        and walls, one side and the other. Finding the pig on my nightstand, I
        move it to my brother’s. My brother, finding the pig on his nightstand,
        moves it back to mine. Over time, the pig is hidden in less obvious
        spots: behind books or objects, among shelves, inside lamps,
        pillowcases, shoes, cereal boxes. My brother moves to another
        neighborhood, and the pig begins traveling from house to house, inside
        backpacks and jacket pockets, smuggled in with the help of a friend or
        secretly slipped into luggage before leaving — for Milan, where I move,
        or Paris, where my brother moves. The object becomes an involuntary
        representation of our relationship. It’s a tacit game, a way to meet.
        It’s a dirty presence in the other’s space, an invasion, in a dialectic
        of intimate agreement. The plastic pig is a totem of a fraternal bond.
