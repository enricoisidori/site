      This book is a collection of strangers’ lines on a blank sheet of paper. “Draw a line from one side of the page to the other”, this is the instruction 100 bypassers were given along with the reminder to freely express themselves on the surface. Where one line ends, another begins – they are all connected – they are individual expressions and a single participatory work. To complete the book, the owner of each copy is asked to draw their own line on the cover, thus becoming part of the project. Following Kandinsky’s theoretical analysis of the proto-elements of art, the line possesses its own internal sonority.
      The book has a soundtrack generated by associating the height of the line with the frequency of the sound. By scrolling through the pages and listening to the corresponding sound, the reader takes a journey into people’s emotions, engaging mind, sight and hearing.
      
      The project was born in 2022 during the Sociology of Cultural and Communicative Processes course of Communication Design at Politecnico di Milano. It was selected and exhibited at Dock Dora and Cavallerizza Reale during the Italian graphic design festival GRAPHIC DAYS in Turin.
