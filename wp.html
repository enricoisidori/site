              The evolution of warfare has shifted dramatically from traditional
              kinetic engagements to cognitive warfare, focusing on the
              increasing integration of neuroscience and technology into
              military strategies. It charts the historical progression of
              cognitive manipulation, from early uses of sound and psychological
              operations to the modern application of neuroscientific and
              neurotechnological tools. The study analyzes how vibrational
              ontology, psychoactive substances, and advanced technologies like
              brain-computer interfaces are strategically deployed to influence
              human cognition, decision-making, and behavior. Crucially, it
              addresses the ethical, legal, and social challenges presented by
              these advancements, particularly the development of neuroweapons
              and the emerging concept of "neurosecurity." The paper argues for
              international dialogue and regulatory frameworks to safeguard
              cognitive sovereignty in the face of growing competition for
              dominance in the cognitive domain, considered a crucial sixth
              dimension of warfare alongside land, sea, air, cyberspace, and
              space. By exploring the implications for both military
              applications and broader society, this work emphasizes the need
              for a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the responsible
              development and governance of these powerful technologies.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <div class="body">
              In recent decades, understanding the functioning of the human
              brain has become a central focus of scientific research, driven by
              advancements in neuroscience and digital technological innovation.
              Since the early 2000s, the increasingly sophisticated development
              of neuroimaging tools and techniques—enabling detailed mapping of
              the nervous system’s structure and functions—has made it possible
              to explore the human brain with unprecedented precision. This has
              led to significant improvements in the understanding, diagnosis,
              and treatment of numerous diseases. At the same time, digital
              technological progress and the convergence of the internet,
              artificial neural networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) have
              highlighted the necessity of comprehending how human interaction
              with technology affects cognitive functions, from memory and
              attention to decision-making processes. The symbiotic relationship
              between neuroscience and technology has given rise to new fields
              of study, attracting the interest of governments, military
              organizations, and private enterprises that have invested
              substantial resources in research initiatives. On the one hand,
              these efforts have driven scientific and technological
              advancements that continue to deepen our understanding of
              cognitive processes and their neurophysiological correlates. On
              the other hand, they have led to the development of techniques and
              tools aimed at modifying and influencing cognitive functions in
              individuals and groups for tactical and strategic purposes. In The
              Art of War, Sun Tzu states that "subduing the enemy without
              fighting is the ultimate skill" [1]. Reformulated in a
              contemporary context, this principle underpins modern
              politico-military strategies and their future developments,
              shifting the operational focus from the physical domain to the
              cognitive one. The objective is to subjugate and manipulate
              adversaries not through direct force or kinetic coercion but by
              targeting their conceptual frameworks, mental logic, perception of
              reality, and behavioral dynamics, thereby destabilizing social and
              political equilibria. For these reasons, today’s geopolitical
              landscape is increasingly shaped by cognitive warfare, an
              integrated strategy that combines elements of psychological
              operations (PSYOPS), information warfare, behavioral science,
              neuroscience, robotics, emerging neuromodulation technologies,
              artificial intelligence, and psychoacoustic tactics designed to
              manipulate human psychology for strategic ends. Cognitive warfare
              extends beyond military operations, playing a pivotal role in
              political influence campaigns, economic destabilization, and
              social fragmentation. This paper examines the fundamental
              principles of cognitive warfare, outlining its historical
              evolution and analyzing the role and operational methodologies of
              emerging neuroscientific and neurotechnological (neuro S/T)
              research within military applications. The intensifying race to
              dominate the human mind raises significant ethical, legal, social,
              and cultural concerns regarding the use of cutting-edge
              technologies. This necessitates an urgent global debate and
              international commitment to the development of regulations and
              countermeasures to safeguard cognitive sovereignty
              (neurosecurity), ensuring the autonomy of individual thought and
              national and global security in the face of the emerging threats
              posed by next-generation cognitive warfare.

            <h1>1. Echoes from the Past</h1>
            <div class="body">
              1.1 Sound as a Weapon: From Archaeoacoustics to Sonic Warfare
              Vibrational ontology refers to the capacity of infrasound (&lt;20
              Hz, below the human auditory threshold), sound (20–20 kHz), and
              ultrasound (&gt;20 kHz, above the human auditory threshold) to
              evoke and induce emotional, sensory, and psychophysiological
              responses in humans. This mechanism is rooted in the phenomenon of
              resonance, first described in 1665 by the Dutch physicist and
              mathematician Christiaan Huygens as the ability of a body, when
              subjected to external oscillations, to begin "vibrating"
              (resonating) at the same frequency as the stimulating source,
              thereby amplifying the effects of the applied frequencies and
              producing various psychophysiological effects. Such knowledge was
              already known to ancient civilizations, as suggested by numerous
              studies in Archaeoacoustics—a discipline emerging in the 1980s and
              1990s that investigates the acoustic properties of archaeological
              sites and ancient artifacts. These studies demonstrate that our
              ancestors possessed a profound understanding of and ability to
              manipulate sound matter to enhance physical, emotional, and
              spiritual well-being. Over time, this expertise was systematically
              applied to the deliberate construction of architectural spaces
              designed to harness and amplify the harmonic resonance of sound
              sources (e.g., the voices of priests) [2] to induce well-being,
              intensify sensory experiences, and facilitate altered states of
              consciousness. Several prehistoric megalithic structures exhibit
              spatial resonance at frequencies between 95 and 120 Hz,
              particularly at 110 Hz [3-5]. Neuroimaging studies, including
              electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (fMRI), suggest that this frequency "may be involved in
              inducing altered states of consciousness or changes in cognitive
              processing" [6], leading to calcium efflux [7] - a biomolecule
              critical for cellular homeostasis - and stimulating activity
              within the CA3 region of the hippocampus [8-9], a brain structure
              involved in memory as well as in subjective anomalous experiences.
              The deep understanding of the cognitive-sensory effects of sound
              was later applied in combat scenarios to instill fear and exert
              psychological pressure on enemies. Examples include the Aztec
              death whistle, whose screaming, terrifying sounds evoked
              significant psychophysical and emotional dimensions [10], as well
              as the horns and war drums used by Mongol and Roman armies. As
              history progressed, the intersection and dynamic interaction
              between technological advancements and scientific progress
              provided numerous promising opportunities to explore how
              vibrational ontology can non-invasively enhance human mental and
              physical health, while also deepening the understanding of how
              sound matter can interfere with and impair cognitive functions and
              an individual’s overall well-being. The speculative use of sound
              acquired new meanings and applications aimed at conquering the
              realms of human perception to exert power and control. Following
              World War I, sound became an essential resource in military
              operations and strategic applications, both in warfare and in
              everyday life, providing a tactical advantage. This led to
              extensive military research into sound-based weaponry, resulting
              in the development of numerous sonic weapons (classified as
              "non-lethal weapons") and highly sophisticated psychoacoustic
              devices with immense destructive potential. Initially designed as
              tools for auditory dominance - intended to disorient and
              demoralize adversaries on the battlefield - these instruments have
              since evolved into destructive assets central to the development
              of new persuasion and manipulation tactics by governments and
              military organizations. The use of sound "both seductive and
              violent, abstract and physical, through a series of acoustic
              machines - biotechnical, social, cultural, artistic, and
              conceptual - designed to modulate the physical, affective, and
              libidinal dynamics of populations, bodies, and crowds" [11] forms
              the conceptual foundation of sonic warfare, or the politics of
              frequency. This approach extends the vibrational ontology of sound
              into a tactical-strategic context, enabling the territorialization
              of sensory perception domains and the colonization of human
              bodies. This shift marks a paradigm change in power structures and
              social control, introducing new dimensions of conflict that
              increasingly transition toward the cognitive domain, laying the
              conceptual groundwork for contemporary cognitive warfare. From the
              deployment of Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD) - capable of
              projecting ultrasonic sound waves of up to 162 dB over long
              distances to suppress protests and restrict population movement -
              to Psychological Operations (PSYOP) developed and deployed by the
              U.S. military, the goal is to influence governments,
              organizations, global superpowers, and civilian populations alike.
              According to the U.S. Department of Defense directive (1984),
              PSYOPs are defined as "planned political, economic, military, and
              ideological activities directed at foreign countries,
              organizations, and individuals to create emotions, attitudes,
              understandings, beliefs, or behaviors favorable to achieving U.S.
              political and military objectives" [12]. These operations aimed at
              influencing governments, organisations, major foreign powers and
              citizens, constitute an important action within the set of
              information, military, economic and diplomatic activities, both in
              military conflicts and in peace contexts. Examples of this are the
              well-known ‘Wandering Soul’ and ‘Urban Funk Campaign’, operations
              carried out by the US army during the Vietnam War to strike at the
              identity of the Vietnamese people, to irritate and terrorise them
              and to destabilise the morale of the Viet Cong army [11], the
              acoustic assault engineered by the United States for the surrender
              of General Manuel Noriega who had taken refuge in the Vatican
              Embassy in Panama, rather than the use of acoustic bombing and
              sound torture through rock, punk and heavy metal music used in the
              Guantanamo prison in Cuba as a method of coercion and sensory
              deprivation to be inflicted on detainees [13-14].

            <div class="body">
              (continua) 1.2 Mind Control Between Technology and Conflict With
              the onset of the Cold War, PSYOP strategies were further refined
              and became increasingly sophisticated and effective, driven by
              advancements in scientific and technological capabilities. Between
              1953 and 1979, a series of incidents known as the "Moscow Signals"
              occurred, in which the Soviet Union irradiated the U.S. Embassy in
              Moscow with microwave emissions ranging from 2 to 7 GHz at a
              maximum radiation intensity of 15 μW/cm² [15-16]. These emissions
              targeted specific sections of the building, allegedly to disrupt
              U.S. intelligence operations [17]. American diplomats reported
              various health issues, including memory loss and difficulty
              concentrating—symptoms associated with microwave radiation
              exposure [17-18], which is known to affect biological systems at
              multiple levels [19]. In humans, such radiation—depending on
              frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure—causes electrons or
              ions to vibrate due to resonance effects, leading to molecular
              collisions within biological tissues [20]. This process
              contributes to brain degeneration, DNA damage, and potential risks
              of neurodegenerative diseases and fertility impairments [17].
              Furthermore, microwaves can stimulate the cochlea similarly to
              auditory stimuli, transmitting impulses directly to the brain that
              induce auditory perceptions such as ringing and tinnitus (the Frey
              effect), or, in extreme cases, cause acute pain and even death due
              to thermally induced damage [21-22]. The success of these
              psychological and physiological manipulations has driven
              governments and military organizations to fund new research
              initiatives focused on understanding the human mind. This has led
              to large-scale governmental projects dedicated to brain research,
              such as the Human Brain Project (HBP)—a ten-year European Union
              initiative launched in 2013 with the objective of "laying the
              technical foundations for a new model of brain research based on
              Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), integrating data
              and knowledge from various disciplines, and catalyzing a
              collective effort to achieve a new understanding of the brain, new
              treatments for brain diseases, and new brain-inspired computing
              technologies" [23]. Among the key outcomes of the HBP are digital
              brain simulation platforms, such as the Virtual Epileptic Patient
              Technology—which enhances surgical interventions for epilepsy
              treatment—and The Virtual Brain (TVB), providing new insights into
              dementia. Other significant achievements include the creation of
              high-resolution 3D brain atlases and the development of
              neuromorphic computing, aimed at designing computing systems with
              brain-like capabilities and improved energy efficiency to enhance
              AI technologies. One of the project's most impactful results has
              been the creation of EBRAINS, an open-source digital platform
              providing advanced tools and a vast database to support ongoing
              research in these fields. In 2013, under the Obama administration,
              the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
              Neurotechnologies) was launched in the U.S., aimed at developing
              novel experimental technologies for studying and controlling brain
              cells. This includes optogenetics, which combines optical and
              genetic techniques to activate or inhibit neural circuits, as well
              as the creation of advanced brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

              The significant potential of emerging neuroscientific methods and
              technologies to access the deepest recesses of the human mind has
              begun to generate renewed and growing interest in governmental and
              military applications. This interest has fostered the development
              of military and intelligence initiatives aimed at producing
              systems and techniques to optimize and enhance the performance of
              soldiers in combat. The objective is to create "super soldiers"—a
              central focus of DARPA’s N3 program—ensuring strategic and
              technological superiority over adversaries while compromising
              their security, stability, and public health, often disregarding
              existing legal frameworks established by international treaties
              and conventions [27]. While such programs are often framed as
              crucial to national security and population protection [27], they
              simultaneously pose a tangible threat, as the same principles can
              be leveraged to negatively influence or even incapacitate
              adversaries. Bioethicist Jonathan Moreno, in his book Mind Wars:
              Brain Research and National Defense (2006), and neuroscientist and
              neuroethicist James Giordano were among the first to draw academic
              attention to the concerning potential of neuroscience applications
              in military contexts. Their work primarily focuses on the
              development and deployment of neurological weapons, explicitly
              designed to undermine the integrity of democratic societies’
              political processes and strategic-military objectives [28] through
              remote brain stimulation. Giordano describes this phenomenon as an
              accelerating race toward the “weaponization of neuroscience”
              [29-30], highlighting the increasing use of neuro S/T research to
              influence cognitive, emotional, and sensory functions via
              biological agents, chemical substances, and the speculative
              manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS)—particularly
              infrasound (&lt;20 Hz), sound, and ultrasound (&gt;20 kHz). These
              new neuroweapons harness the destructive potential of sound matter
              within NeuroStrike strategies, incapacitating individuals on a
              psychophysiological level by inducing resonant frequencies within
              the brain and internal organs, leading to cognitive dysfunction,
              disorientation, and even lasting physical damage. From memory,
              learning abilities, and cognitive speed to decision-making
              processes, from self-perception to mood modulation and emotions
              such as empathy and trust, from impulse control to
              wakefulness-sleep cycles and fatigue-alertness balance, as well as
              motor functions and performance (e.g., speed, strength, endurance,
              etc.) [31], the ability to modify and control these functions in
              military and strategic contexts represents an unprecedented
              advantage—allowing for the effective and targeted "neutralization"
              of adversaries.

            <h1>2.2 Cognitive Warfare</h1>
            <div class="body">
              Since 2016, numerous military personnel and diplomatic officials
              stationed abroad have reported experiencing psychophysical
              distress following exposure to loud and discomforting localized
              sounds. These incidents, collectively known as the Havana
              Syndrome, were first documented at the U.S. and Canadian embassies
              in Cuba before spreading to governmental and military personnel in
              China, Russia, Austria, India, Vietnam, Colombia, Uzbekistan,
              Kyrgyzstan, and Washington, D.C. [16]. Affected individuals
              exhibited consistent neurophysiological and cognitive symptoms,
              including headaches, fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, nausea, vertigo,
              memory loss, traumatic brain injuries, and concussions. Initially
              dismissed as a mass psychosis, subsequent medical investigations
              and neuroimaging studies have provided compelling evidence linking
              these symptoms to sonic attacks executed with unidentified
              neuroweapons, specifically Directed Energy Weapons (DEW). Clinical
              examinations using neuroimaging techniques have revealed
              significant alterations in total brain white matter volume,
              regional gray and white matter volume, microstructural integrity
              of cerebellar tissue, and functional connectivity within auditory
              processing regions. Given that none of the affected individuals
              had preexisting brain injuries or hearing impairments, the
              cognitive effects observed in diplomats, intelligence officials,
              and military personnel were deemed "consistent with the biological
              effects of modulated or pulsed radiofrequency energy" [16]—a
              technology previously tested by Russia. The Havana Syndrome is now
              widely recognized as the inaugural event of cognitive warfare,
              marking the first documented use of neuroweapons and NeuroStrikes
              to target the human nervous system, influencing cognitive,
              emotional, and/or motor functions (e.g., perception, judgment,
              morale, pain tolerance, physical abilities, and endurance)" [32].
              The adoption of cognitive strategies represents a fundamental
              paradigm shift in power structures and social organization,
              transitioning from panoptic control—a surveillance model inspired
              by Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon prison design (1791), characterized
              by constant visibility and oversight [33]—to a pansensory form of
              control [11]. This transition introduces an "invisible" dimension
              of power, one that directly targets bodies, identities, and
              sensory experiences. This paradigm shift paves the way for a
              future shaped by panpsychic control, wherein remote mind influence
              becomes the central axis of political and military strategy. As
              these tactics and operations grow increasingly subliminal, silent,
              and difficult to detect, the challenge of exposing, countering,
              and regulating cognitive warfare becomes more urgent than ever.

            <div class="body">
              Since the second decade of the 2000s, the concept of cognitive
              warfare has gained increasing prominence and concern within
              medical-scientific research, strategic discourse, and
              geopolitical, military, social, and cultural structures. First
              defined by NATO’s Allied Command Transformation (ACT)—a military
              command established in 2003 to develop and enhance the alliance’s
              defense and offensive capabilities—cognitive warfare is
              conceptualized as a "set of activities conducted in
              synchronization with other instruments of power to modify
              attitudes and behaviors by influencing, protecting, or disrupting
              individual and group cognition to gain an advantage over an
              adversary" [34]. Unlike traditional warfare, which relies on
              kinetic force, cognitive warfare aims at the conquest of the human
              mind, now regarded as the new battlefield—the sixth domain of
              operations [27, 29], following the five domains already colonized
              by military power: land, sea, air, cyberspace, and outer space
              [29]. In line with NATO’s initial conceptualization, cognitive
              warfare operates through a vast array of hybrid strategies,
              seamlessly blending offensive actions to blur the line between
              peacetime and conflict. It employs "deliberate targeting of the
              human mind through offensive actions designed to influence
              perceptions, beliefs, interests, objectives, decisions, and
              behaviors" [34]. Cognitive control is applied by governments and
              military bodies through a combination of direct and indirect
              technological and strategic tools, aimed at both manipulating
              perceptions and behaviors and enhancing or impairing brain
              functions in targeted individuals or populations. Depending on the
              method of action, these interventions can be categorized into
              three main types: influence, interference, and alteration [35].

            <h1>4. Future Speculative Scenarios</h1>
            <div class="body">
              The rapid evolution of neuroweapons raises critical ethical,
              legal, and social concerns, underscoring the urgent need for
              protective measures against potential threats to cognitive
              security. In this context, the concept of the neuroshield
              emerges—an integrated defense system designed to encompass
              specific regulations, media industry codes of conduct, and
              practical tools to safeguard citizens’ cognitive liberty. This
              approach would extend beyond military applications, significantly
              impacting everyday life, particularly in counteracting
              informational manipulation conducted through digital platforms,
              with profound implications for democracy and geopolitical
              stability [43]. The implementation of ethical standards and
              international regulations thus becomes a strategic priority,
              particularly in preventing unauthorized access to cognitive data
              by hostile actors, including foreign states and cybercriminal
              organizations. The increasing ability to modulate human cognitive
              processes necessitates a strategic approach to neurosecurity,
              which should be integrated into risk management strategies at both
              political and military levels. One of the emerging threats in this
              domain involves the development of neural malware. A research team
              at the University of Washington (Seattle) successfully translated
              a simple computer command into a sequence of 176 human DNA
              letters, which was then inserted into a sequencing machine. The
              machine converted these DNA sequences into binary code (0s and
              1s), effectively allowing the malware to take control of a
              computer. This experiment highlights a potential future risk where
              DNA samples could be exploited in cyberattacks, granting
              unauthorized access to digital databases and sensitive private
              information [44]. To address these growing challenges, new
              defensive solutions are being explored, including the development
              of cerebral firewalls—protective systems designed to shield both
              soldiers and civilians from psychological and cognitive attacks.
              At the same time, the rising interest in neurosecurity is
              reflected in increased public investment in neuroscience and
              neurotechnology research, with a particular emphasis on: the study
              of complex cognitive functions such as empathy, consciousness, and
              language; the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms affecting the
              brain; the development of interventions for neurological and
              mental disorders. Ultimately, the future of cognitive security
              will require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating scientific
              research, technological innovation, and ethical regulation. Only
              through responsible governance of neurotechnologies can we ensure
              the protection of both individual and collective cognitive
              faculties, preventing the misuse of emerging methods of cognitive
              manipulation.

              Cognitive warfare's principles have been examined, outlining its
              historical evolution and the role of emerging neuroscientific and
              neurotechnological applications in military strategy. The growing
              race to control the human mind is reshaping power dynamics,
              raising critical ethical, legal, social, and cultural questions.
              NBIC science advancements are opening unprecedented scenarios for
              cognitive warfare, with applications ranging from cognitive
              enhancement to individual and collective manipulation. These
              developments demand urgent debate and coordinated international
              effort to establish effective regulations, ensuring cognitive
              sovereignty and safeguarding individual autonomy and global
              security. Further technical and strategic insights will be
              explored in four dedicated White Papers, focusing on NBIC's
